# Behind-ML

Historically, artificial intelligence had been presented abstractly, hiding the maths behind a model. Spoiler! The models are not magic and only replicate the patterns which had been learned.

Behind Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents a new series of articles. These articles will be divided into the different algorithms we can implement, starting from the easiest. The goal of each the article is going to teach how to build the different models and understand how it works.
